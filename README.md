# Password Generator

This is a simple project that randomly generates a password. 

## Installation

1. Download this repo. Using `git clone https://github.com/erickrsk8/Password_Generator.git`.
2. Navigate to this repo containing this README and two python scripts using `cd /path/to/Password_Generator`.
3. Run the setup.py file using `python setup.py` (if you get an error, you may need to run `python3 setup.py`).
4. This file adds the "passgen" function to your rc file in order to have it run as a simple command.

## Functionality

Once installation is complete, run the `passgen` command to generate a random password.

You can add any number under 70 after the command to designate password length (why would you want such a long password??)

## Future Releases

* Add the a flag to designate whether symbols should or should not be used.
