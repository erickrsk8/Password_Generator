# Password Generator

This project is a simple comand line password generator made with python/bash.

Python is used to make the generator itself and zsh is used to create a function, allowing you to run the python script using a single command while also passing arguments.

## TO-DO

* Need to insert input validation into code.
* Need to add this project to my personal github (requires reconfiguring my stupid github creds).
* Need input validation for character limit, check for only integers, option for symbols
